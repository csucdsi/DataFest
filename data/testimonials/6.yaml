text: "NorCal DataFest was such a challenging and rewarding experience. I liken it to a cold-plunge; the shock filled my body as I entered the waters and I thought to myself "can I even do this," but once I embraced the discomfort it somehow became more manageable. By the end of it I was filled with this strange sense of satisfaction that left me thinking "I kind of want to do it again." I got to see what data science and analytics actually looks like all the while gaining resume worthy experience. If you're considering attending, do it!"
