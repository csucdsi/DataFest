## Security & Access

# Social Media

Did you know that, this year, DataFest will be held at [over 70
universities around the world](https://ww2.amstat.org/education/datafest/participants.cfm)?
DataFest takes place during a six-week window in the Spring, and
different universities hold their event at different times.

An essential ingredient of Datafest is that the data be a surprise.
There are several reasons for this. One is that it ensures that all
teams start on an equal footing. Another is that, even if you research
the organization that donated the data, you might still be totally
unprepared for the context of the data (and maybe less prepared than had
you known nothing!) Finally, it is simply more fun.

You are encouraged to share your excitement on social media and thank
our sponsors. The official Twitter hashtag is #ASAdatafest25. However...

PLEASE KEEP THE SECRET UNTIL May 3rd!. Teams that leak the name or any information about the identify of the data donor will be disqualified!

Please do not post pictures that reveal any charts/graphs/tables/summaries/models that might reveal the data donor.

# Presentations, judging, and awards

## Presentations

Each team will have 4 minutes + 1 minute Q&A to present their findings
to the judges. That’s exactly 4 minutes, not 4 minutes and a few
additional seconds. Each team will be allowed at most two slides. Two!
So at some point Saturday night or Sunday morning, you might want to set
aside time to think about what you want the judges to know. The 4 minute
presentation and 1 minute Q&A time limits will be strictly enforced. All
team members must be present for the presentation, but not all team
members need to actually speak (given the time limitation).

**Optional**

Along with your presentation you are also allowed to turn in a one-page
write-up of your project. You can think about this as the text of your
presentation. The judges can refer to these during deliberation. You
will upload these documents along with your presentation. Only 1 page
will be printed.

#### Submitting your presentation

Sunday morning all work must stop at a time specified on the schedule. Each team upload their presentation and optional write up to the submission  URL provided by the organizers. If you are having technical difficulty, you can ask a coach for help. 

Teams who fail to upload their presentations and write-ups late will not be eligible to have their presentations judged.

#### File naming

The files you’re submitting must be named in the following manner:

-   [Team Name] - Presentation
-   [Team Name] - Writeup

#### Allowed file formats

-   We very strongly recommend using PDF, Keynote, or PowerPoint.
-   If using a web-based tool like GoogleDocs or Prezi, please export to
    PDF and upload the PDF as your submission.

Note that you will not have time to log on/off to your account before
your presentation. We don’t want to restrict your creativity but it is
your responsibility to make sure that your presentation works seamlessly
before the judging session begins.

## Judging

The Judges will convene in a side room to deliberate and rank their
nominations. Three of these will be selected for the award categories
listed below. The judges also have the option to name a fourth winner as
Judges' Pick.

All are welcomed to the presentations and award ceremony.

## Awards

Awards will be given in three categories:

-   Best Insight
-   Best Use of Outside Data
-   Best Visualization

These are listed in no particular order.

The judges also have the option to name a fourth winner as Judges' Pick.

Winners will receive medals and books as well as one-year student
memberships to the American Statistical Association. See
<http://www.amstat.org/membership/> for membership benefits.

#### Raffle prizes

-   Throughout the event we will be giving out raffle prizes.
    Announcements for these will be shared on social media or through
    Discord. Follow these channels to get a chance to win one of these
    sweet prizes!
-   Winning will also require that you are on premises at the time a
    prize is announced.

## Recruiting

DataFest is a great recruiting opportunity for many employers, and
surely they won’t miss it!

Many of our sponsors are attending the event so you can find out more
about them.

Most of our coaches are coming from companies who are recruiting or at a
minimum wanting to meet you, so chat with them, find out what they do,
network.

We will collect resumes and share them with some of our sponsors.
Participation in the resume book is optional, but highly recommended.
You will receive information about this during the event.

# Rules

-   You can come and go as you please, but all work must be completed on
    premises.

-   Do not use any space other than the designated classrooms, or work
    after the event closes for the night. Students found working in other areas 
    or after hours will be disqualified from the competition.

-   You must follow the Code of Conduct. This can be found at
    <https://norcaldatafest.netlify.com/faq/> and printed at the event.

-   Do not share the name of the data source publicly or on social media
    before May 3rd. There are many other upcoming DataFests around
    the country and we want to make sure the dataset remains a surprise
    for them.

-   Before your team gets the data all members must have signed
    Non-Disclosure agreement on file at the registration desk. You can
    freely share your results, presentations, findings, etc. as part of
    your digital portfolio, however you are not allowed to share the raw
    data with anyone outside of DataFest. At the end of DataFest, you
    must delete all data from thumb drives, hard drives, etc. The data
    are sensitive.

-   As much as possible during the event there will be a friendly
    coaches present. These are faculty, grad students, or other
    professionals from our community. Not all will have field specific
    knowledge on the data set. They all have different areas of
    expertise, so if you get stuck on something and one coach isn’t able
    to help, ask someone else later. Feel free to ask anything. This is
    not an exam, but a collaborative competition. Do not expect the
    coaches to write code for you, or do data management, etc. They are
    there to help point you in the right direction, but you're
    responsible for getting there on your own.

-   PLEASE KEEP THE SECRET UNTIL MAY 3rd. Teams that leak the name or any
    information about the identify of the data donor will be
    disqualified! Please do not post pictures that reveal any
    charts/graphs/tables/summaries/models that might reveal the data
    donor.

-   Please do not tweet, create a TikTok, hashtag, Facebook, snapchat,
    etc about the identify of the donor or the context of the data. This
    means you should refrain from any hints, explicit or implicit
    statements that might reveal the context of the data.

-   Be careful about github repositories. Make sure yours is invisible
    to the outside world.
