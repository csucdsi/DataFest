# The data
The data this year was provided by the Olympic Champion Canadian National Women's Rugby team. A complex set of four different datasets containing GPS tracking data during games, physical wellness surveys, and training workload. The data provider asked students to consider role of workload and fatigue in Rugby 7's, a fast-paced very physically demanding sport that pushes the limits of athletic speed, endurance and toughness.


# The people

We had 48 students from 6 different schools register as 12 teams. The diversity of the student majors was remarkable. This year we had representation from Mathematics & Statistics (35%), Computer Science (26%), Business (28%) and Other majors (17%). In the end, six teams presented their findings. Each team had five minutes and a maximum of two slides (one team created a video presentation) to present findings to a panel of judges. 


# The winners

Teams presented informative findings on what an optimal training workload could look like at different points in the season, or how certain summative wellness measures that are currently being used could be optimized to provide better predictive ability. The winning teams were:
