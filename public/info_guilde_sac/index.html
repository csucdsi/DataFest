<p>Our goal is to keep you fed &amp; caffeinated all weekend long. Check the
Schedule for mealtimes.</p>
<h2 id="security--access">Security &amp; Access</h2>
<h1 id="social-media">Social Media</h1>
<p>Did you know that, this year, DataFest will be held at <a href="https://ww2.amstat.org/education/datafest/participants.cfm">over 70
universities around the
world</a>?
DataFest takes place during a six-week window in the Spring, and
different universities hold their event at different times.</p>
<p>An essential ingredient of Datafest is that the data be a surprise.
There are several reasons for this. One is that it ensures that all
teams start on an equal footing. Another is that, even if you research
the organization that donated the data, you might still be totally
unprepared for the context of the data (and maybe less prepared than had
you known nothing!) Finally, it is simply more fun.</p>
<p>You are encouraged to share your excitement on social media and thank
our sponsors. The official Twitter hashtag is #ASAdatafest25. However&hellip;</p>
<p>PLEASE KEEP THE SECRET UNTIL May 4th!. Teams that leak the name or any
information about the identify of the data donor will be disqualified!</p>
<p>Please do not post pictures that reveal any
charts/graphs/tables/summaries/models that might reveal the data donor.</p>
<h1 id="presentations-judging-and-awards">Presentations, judging, and awards</h1>
<h2 id="presentations">Presentations</h2>
<p>Each team will have 4 minutes + 1 minute Q&amp;A to present their findings
to the judges. That’s exactly 4 minutes, not 4 minutes and a few
additional seconds. Each team will be allowed at most two slides. Two!
So at some point Saturday night or Sunday morning, you might want to set
aside time to think about what you want the judges to know. The 4 minute
presentation and 1 minute Q&amp;A time limits will be strictly enforced. All
team members must be present for the presentation, but not all team
members need to actually speak (given the time limitation).</p>
<p><strong>Optional</strong></p>
<p>Along with your presentation you are also allowed to turn in a one-page
write-up of your project. You can think about this as the text of your
presentation. The judges can refer to these during deliberation. You
will upload these documents along with your presentation. Only 1 page
will be printed.</p>
<h4 id="submitting-your-presentation">Submitting your presentation</h4>
<p>At 1pm on Sunday all work must stop and you must upload your
presentation and your optional write up to the submission website linked
at the top of this page (available starting Sunday AM). If you are
having technical difficulty, you can ask a coach for help. Coaches will
be around to help.</p>
<p>Teams who fail to upload their presentations and write-ups by 1:00pm on
Sunday will not be eligible to have their presentations judged.</p>
<h4 id="file-naming">File naming</h4>
<p>The files you’re submitting must be named in the following manner:</p>
<ul>
<li>[Team Name] - Presentation</li>
<li>[Team Name] - Writeup</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="allowed-file-formats">Allowed file formats</h4>
<ul>
<li>We very strongly recommend using PDF, Keynote, or PowerPoint.</li>
<li>If using a web-based tool like GoogleDocs or Prezi, please export to
PDF and upload the PDF as your submission.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that you will not have time to log on/off to your account before
your presentation. We don’t want to restrict your creativity but it is
your responsibility to make sure that your presentation works seamlessly
before the judging session begins.</p>
<h2 id="judging">Judging</h2>
<p>The Judges will convene in a side room to deliberate and rank their
nominations. Three of these will be selected for the award categories
listed below. The judges also have the option to name a fourth winner as
Judges&rsquo; Pick.</p>
<p>All are welcomed to the presentations and award ceremony.</p>
<h2 id="awards">Awards</h2>
<p>Awards will be given in three categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Best Insight</li>
<li>Best Use of Outside Data</li>
<li>Best Visualization</li>
</ul>
<p>These are listed in no particular order.</p>
<p>The judges also have the option to name a fourth winner as Judges&rsquo; Pick.</p>
<p>Winners will receive medals and books as well as one-year student
memberships to the American Statistical Association. See
<a href="http://www.amstat.org/membership/">http://www.amstat.org/membership/</a> for membership benefits.</p>
<h4 id="raffle-prizes">Raffle prizes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Throughout the event we will be giving out raffle prizes.
Announcements for these will be shared on social media or through
Discord. Follow these channels to get a chance to win one of these
sweet prizes!</li>
<li>Winning will also require that you are on premises at the time a
prize is announced.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="recruiting">Recruiting</h2>
<p>DataFest is a great recruiting opportunity for many employers, and
surely they won’t miss it!</p>
<p>Many of our sponsors are attending the event so you can find out more
about them.</p>
<p>Most of our coaches are coming from companies who are recruiting or at a
minimum wanting to meet you, so chat with them, find out what they do,
network.</p>
<p>We will collect resumes and share them with some of our sponsors.
Participation in the resume book is optional, but highly recommended.
You will receive information about this during the event.</p>
<h1 id="rules">Rules</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can come and go as you please, but all work must be completed on
premises.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not use any space other than the designated classrooms, or work
after 10pm Students found working in other areas or after 10pm will
be disqualified from the competition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You must follow the Code of Conduct. This can be found at
<a href="https://norcaldatafest.netlify.com/faq/">https://norcaldatafest.netlify.com/faq/</a> and printed at the event.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not share the name of the data source publicly or on social media
before April 29th. There are many other upcoming DataFests around
the country and we want to make sure the dataset remains a surprise
for them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before your team gets the data all members must have signed
Non-Disclosure agreement on file at the registration desk. You can
freely share your results, presentations, findings, etc. as part of
your digital portfolio, however you are not allowed to share the raw
data with anyone outside of DataFest. At the end of DataFest, you
must delete all data from thumb drives, hard drives, etc. The data
are sensitive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As much as possible during the event there will be a friendly
coaches present. These are faculty, grad students, or other
professionals from our community. Not all will have field specific
knowledge on the data set. They all have different areas of
expertise, so if you get stuck on something and one coach isn’t able
to help, ask someone else later. Feel free to ask anything. This is
not an exam, but a collaborative competition. Do not expect the
coaches to write code for you, or do data management, etc. They are
there to help point you in the right direction, but you&rsquo;re
responsible for getting there on your own.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PLEASE KEEP THE SECRET UNTIL MAY 4. Teams that leak the name or any
information about the identify of the data donor will be
disqualified! Please do not post pictures that reveal any
charts/graphs/tables/summaries/models that might reveal the data
donor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please do not tweet, create a TikTok, hashtag, Facebook, snapchat,
etc about the identify of the donor or the context of the data. This
means you should refrain from any hints, explicit or implicit
statements that might reveal the context of the data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be careful about github repositories. Make sure yours is invisible
to the outside world.</p>
</li>
